# Plan — situated dry-run probes

Method: situated probes against the actual deployment targets — an Opus subagent (via the Agent tool) and
`codex exec --sandbox read-only` — with `SKILL.md` in context, plus the one `reference/` file named by a probe
when it names one (probes that test whether a reference stands alone withhold `SKILL.md`). Require the
executor to **cite the file and the exact sentence** that decided each answer, and to **flag ambiguity as a
valid answer** — flagged ambiguities are findings to feed back into the wording, not failures. Grade
pass/fail against the key. **The answer key is written before any runs** and graded against the plan's
acceptance criteria (`plans/4-extract-plan.html`, ids ac-1..ac-10) — the plan is the source of truth; do not
grade against looser criteria.

The file-check criteria (ac-1, ac-3, ac-4, ac-5, ac-6, ac-7, ac-8) are additionally confirmed by
grep/parse against the tree, as the staffing/review-loop evals do for their structural criteria. The probes
below exercise the *routing and understanding* of the contract where a reasoning probe adds value. Probes P1
through P5 are the **five core routing probes ac-9 names**; each must pass on **both** executors.

## Probes

**P1 (ac-9a, core).** You are asked to plan a **non-code effort** — a two-week competitor-research sprint.
Walk the gates: is `plan` willing to plan a non-code undertaking at all? When you reach the approval gate, how
do you present the plan for sign-off — do you build a review UI, or something else? Name the mechanism and
cite it.

**P2 (ac-9b, core).** A caller asks you to plan a **one-line copy fix** to a settings label — trivial,
reversible, a few minutes. What does gate 1 decide, and on what rule? Cite the threshold.

**P3 (ac-9c, core).** Mid-flow you need to decide **which model should author this plan**, and later who
should build what it describes. Does `plan` carry its own model ranking? What does it do instead? Name the
skill and cite the sentence.

**P4 (ac-9d, core).** `review-loop`'s await returned **request-changes** on your plan. What is the required
sequence before you re-present, and whose contract owns the ledger step? Be specific about what must be
written for each prior annotation. Cite it.

**P5 (ac-9e, core).** A human just **approved** your plan. What is the deliverable, and what must you **not**
do next? Is committing the plan or starting the implementation part of this skill? Cite the rule.

**P6 (ac-2).** A workflow skill wants to depend on `plan`. From `SKILL.md`, list the three kinds of
dependency pointer the skill declares, and state exactly which **sibling skills** it names and the role of
each.

**P7 (ac-3).** Does `plan` ship a review server or await script of its own? When it presents a plan, what
exactly does it invoke, and by what means — a file import or a name? Cite the convention.

**P8 (ac-4, ac-5).** Read `reference/plan-contract.md` **without** `SKILL.md`. Does the gate sequence include
a "commit the plan" or "start implementing" gate? Where do those steps live, and whose concern are they? Does
the contract assume the undertaking is code, or a running app? Cite the sentences.

**P9 (ac-6).** You are invoking `plan` in a repo that has **no `docs/agents/planning.md` and no review
surface**. Can the skill still run? What provides the threshold, format, and gates, and what happens at the
approval gate? Cite the two-layer / local-fallback rules.

**P10 (ac-7).** Read `templates/plan-skeleton.html`. Does it carry the stable-id contract (stable section
ids; `<li id="ac-N" data-criterion>` criteria)? Is it self-contained (inline styles/SVG, no external
fetches)? Does its header comment bake in any workflow-specific ("backlog") identity? Cite what you checked.

**P11 (ac-8).** Read `skills/delivery/plan/agents/openai.yaml`. Is it well-formed per `AGENTS.md` § Conventions (the `agents/openai.yaml` rule),
and is `allow_implicit_invocation` set correctly for a skill that runs a multi-gate flow and holds an
approval gate? State the value and why it is right.

**P12 (ac-10).** Backlog invokes `plan` for an enhancement. After the approval event, which skill owns
committing the plan, mirroring it to the tracker, and starting implementation? Cite the module boundary.

**P13 (issue 53).** The proposed plan claims an unfamiliar editor library routes pasted images by schema
ordering, but nobody has exercised that runtime path. What must the plan record and do before dependent work?

**P14 (issue 54).** A criterion says “a second user sees the result at 1,000-file scale,” but setup records
one account and no feasible large fixture. What fields must the criterion carry, and when is a substitute
allowed to be chosen?

## Answer key

- **P1 (ac-9a):** Yes — `plan` is **domain-neutral**; a research sprint is a valid undertaking (SKILL.md
  description / § domain-neutral). At the approval gate it does **not** build a review UI — it **presents the
  plan through the `review-loop` skill by name** (serve → annotate → verdict-coded await). Cite
  plan-contract.md § gate 4 / SKILL.md § Composition. Building an ad hoc review UI, or refusing a non-code
  undertaking, = fail.
- **P2 (ac-9b):** Gate 1 **decides to skip** — a small, low-risk, easily-reversible change does not earn a
  plan; go straight to the work. Rule: the plan-or-skip threshold (touches >1 area / hard to unwind / risky or
  >~1 day). Cite plan-contract.md § gate 1 "Decided". Answering "write a full plan" = fail.
- **P3 (ac-9c):** **No** — `plan` carries no roster of its own. It resolves "which model?" against the
  installed roster via the **`staffing`** skill by name, for both authoring and building. Cite SKILL.md
  § Dependency surface / plan-contract.md § Composition ("resolve against the installed roster via the
  `staffing` skill by name"). Inventing a ranking inline = fail.
- **P4 (ac-9d):** On **request-changes**: **revise the plan → write a ledger disposition
  (`changed`/`kept`/`orphaned`) for every prior annotation → re-present → re-await.** The ledger step is a
  mechanic **`review-loop` owns**; plan honors it. Never revise without the ledger. Cite plan-contract.md
  § gate 4 "On request-changes". Omitting the ledger, or attributing it to plan's own runtime, = fail.
- **P5 (ac-9e):** The deliverable is **the approval record** — the approve event (verdict, content hash,
  timestamp) bound to the version the human saw. You must **not** commit the plan or start implementing — the
  gate sequence **stops at Approved**; committing and building are the **caller's** concern (there is no gate
  5). Cite plan-contract.md § "What this skill does not do" / SKILL.md § gate 4. Answering "commit it and
  start building" = fail.
- **P6 (ac-2):** Three pointer kinds: **bundled references** (its own `plan-contract.md` + `authoring.md` +
  the skeleton), **project playbook** (`docs/agents/planning.md`, delta-only), **sibling skills**. Siblings
  are required **`review-loop`** = sign-off and **`staffing`** = routing, plus optional **`prototype`** for
  questions paper cannot settle. Missing a pointer kind or misclassifying an edge = fail.
- **P7 (ac-3):** **No** — plan ships no `review-server`/`review-await` and no `scripts/` dir. To present a
  plan it **invokes the `review-loop` skill by plain name**, not by importing its files (`AGENTS.md`
  § Conventions "compose by name, not by file"). Cite SKILL.md / plan-contract.md § Composition. Saying it
  copies or imports review-loop's scripts = fail.
- **P8 (ac-4, ac-5):** **No** commit/implement gate — the sequence ends at **Approved**; committing the plan
  and starting the work are the **caller's** concern (plan-contract.md § "What this skill does not do"). The
  contract is **domain-neutral** — it does not assume code or a running app; acceptance criteria are
  "checkable pass/fail," and dev rigor is the project playbook's to add. Cite both sentences. Claiming a
  commit/implement gate, or that the contract assumes a running app, = fail.
- **P9 (ac-6):** **Yes, it still runs.** The **bundled references** carry the full default contract
  (threshold, format, gates), so no `docs/agents/planning.md` is required — the playbook is a **delta-only**
  override. With no review surface, the approval gate uses the **local fallback**: open the rendered plan on
  the machine, say remote review is unavailable, take the verdict in conversation — never improvise a public
  tunnel. Cite plan-contract.md §§ "Project playbook (delta-only)" / gate 4 "Local fallback". Saying it
  hard-stops without a playbook = fail.
- **P10 (ac-7):** The skeleton carries stable section ids and `<li id="ac-N" data-criterion>` criteria, is
  self-contained (inline styles + inline SVG, no external fetches), and its header comment cites the `plan`
  skill's own `reference/authoring.md` with **no** "backlog"/workflow identity baked in. Cite the header
  comment + a `data-criterion` line. Claiming it embeds backlog identity or pulls external assets = fail.
- **P11 (ac-8):** Well-formed: `interface.display_name` "Plan", a one-line `short_description` matching the
  SKILL.md spirit, a concrete `default_prompt`, and `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`. `false` is
  correct because plan runs a **multi-gate flow and holds a human approval gate** — not a lightweight advisory
  skill; codex-compat.md says default `false` for skills that run loops. Cite codex-compat.md. Saying `true`
  is fine for this skill, or the YAML being malformed, = fail.
- **P12 (ac-10):** PASS only if `plan` stops at the approval record and `backlog`, as caller, owns the commit,
  tracker mirror, and implementation tail. Cite `README.md` § Not in scope or `reference/plan-contract.md`
  § What this skill does not do.
- **P13 (issue 53):** PASS only if the claim is labeled an assumption-to-validate with a predicted
  observation and cheapest runtime-real red-capable falsification probe, routed to prototype/spike, and
  validated before dependent design/build. A mock that bypasses the path fails.
- **P14 (issue 54):** PASS only if the criterion names entities, scale/feasibility, account/tenant, fixture
  lifetime, and observation mechanism; it must be rewritten or receive an explicit substitute at plan
  approval, never improvised by verify.

## Scoring

14 probes × 2 executors (one Claude route + one Codex route). A probe passes only with the **correct action AND a
correct citation**. P1–P5 are the five core routing probes ac-9 names and must pass on both executors.
Ambiguity flags are recorded as findings, not failures — they drive wording fixes before ship. Report a
verdict table mapping each probe → its criterion → pass/fail per executor.

The structural criteria are additionally confirmed by grep/parse against the tree: **ac-1** (layout present,
no `scripts/`), **ac-3** (no copied server/await scripts, no cross-skill path import), **ac-4** (no
commit/implement/posterity in the bundled contract), **ac-5** (no running-app/verify/evidence/repo terms in
the bundled contract), **ac-6** (two-layer + local-fallback stated), **ac-7** (skeleton stable ids +
self-contained + neutral header), and **ac-8** (`openai.yaml` parses).
